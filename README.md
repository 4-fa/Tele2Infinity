# Tele2Infinity
Automatically activates free bundleboosters for Tele2 unlimited in the Netherlands.

## Usage
- Run the app and follow instructions. 
- Edit **config.json** according to your needs.

Example config:

    {
      "TargetBundleCode": "T2_NL_UNL_FREE_AANVULLER", // The bundle it needs to activate. (leave it)
      "InternetSpeedInMbps": 40, // Your average internet download speed from speedtest.net
      "BundleThresholdInMB": 500 // Will activate bundle when data is lower than threshold MBs.
    }

## Fair use
This tool is only intended for lazy people who don't want to keep track on their data usage and hate refreshing the app when data is running low.
Don't use this to download gigabytes of anything. Tele2 will ban you because they are not actually supporting unlimited data. (Yep, shitty marketing for sure)
